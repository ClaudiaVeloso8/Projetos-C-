BookLender: A Comprehensive MVC CRUD Application for Efficient Book Management
My project is an MVC application developed in C#, implementing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with a connection to a database. The main purpose of the application is to manage a book lending system. Users can input information about the books they have lent out, including details such as the borrower's name, the date of the loan, and other relevant data. The application allows users to perform essential operations such as adding new entries, editing existing records, deleting entries, and selecting specific entries based on various parameters. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the Model handling the data and business logic, the View responsible for the user interface, and the Controller managing the communication between the Model and the View. The application provides a user-friendly interface for efficient book management, enabling users to easily track and organize their lending activities."
